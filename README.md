# 🤖 ez-pr-bot

EZ PR Bot is a Slack bot that accelerates the PR review process for your team!

## 🤔 Why

Getting your code changes reviewed can be more laborious than it should be.

EZ PR Bot solves this by encapsulating the entire code PR review workflow into a simple shortcut, that makes them actionable and trackable.

## Future Extensions

See our Github projects for an updated look at our planned/upcoming work, but here's our planned roadmap.

```text
.
├── V0.5.0 - CLI
│   ├── /help
│   ├── /ezpr
│   ├── delete pr review request
│   └── /statistics: view stats for your PRs/your team's PRs e.g. time-to-merge, time-to-approve, actual-review-time
├── V1.0.0 - Interactivity via UI
|   ├── Forms/modals for easier use of /help, /ezpr, etc.
|   ├── Shortcuts compatibility
│   ├── /assign: assign reviewers to your PR or randomly choose from a role
│   ├── /reminders: send reminders to assigned reviewers if PR still open after X time or next work day
│   └── /openprs: view a list of open prs that require your review
├── V2.0.0 - TBD
└── README.md                       # You are here! :)
```

Some other ideas still under evaluation:

- Urgency: Communicate to reviewers that this PR is urgent, maybe itll dm the team?
- If 5 mins ETR selected —> assign reviewer(s) —> DM reviewer(s)
- Github integration: inform that PR needs re-review after changes are pushed
